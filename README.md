KM (Kanna Mapper) helps you auto-generate mapping between types and supports configuration using a TOML configuration file.

⚠️ It's still in early development so do not use it in production, also I am planning on a better usage experience.

## Why KM?

Unlike other mappers, KM leverages code generation and does not use reflection, which means there are no errors during runtime, and offers much better performance than other solutions that use reflection.

## Usage

Coming soon...

## Upcoming
- [ ] Adding more tests 
- [ ] Support for map <-> struct
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Handle conversion between types
